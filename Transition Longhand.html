        transition-property: Specifies the CSS properties the transition effect is for. In this case, the div will expand
both horizontally and vertically when hovered.
transition-duration: Specifies the length of time a transition takes to complete. In the above example, the
height and width transitions will take 1 second and 500 milliseconds respectively.
transition-timing-function: Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect. A linear value indicates the
transition will have the same speed from start to finish.
transition-delay: Specifies the amount of time needed to wait before the transition effect starts. In this case,
the height will start transitioning immediately, whereas the width will wait 1 second.
